DHCP Setup

Click on the router, go to the CLI tab and enter commands

enable
configure terminal

Configure DHCP for Devices on Switch 1 by creating DHCP pool and excluding the Router's IP Address

ip dhcp pool SWITCH1_POOL
network 168.90.0.0 255.255.0.0
default-router 168.90.0.1
dns-server 8.8.8.8
ip dhcp excluded-address 168.90.0.1

Similarly, configure DHCP for Devices on Switch 2

ip dhcp pool SWITCH2_POOL
network 210.3.14.0 255.255.255.0
default-router 210.3.14.1
dns-server 8.8.8.8
ip dhcp excluded-address 210.3.14.1

Finally, assign IP addresses to router interfaces so they can act as gateways for our networks

For Switch 1 (GigabitEthernet0/0):

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 168.90.0.1 255.255.0.0
no shutdown
exit

For Switch 2 (GigabitEthernet0/1):

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
ip address 210.3.14.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit

Verify DHCP by going to each PC, Laptop and Server, opening Desktop > IP Configuration and selecting DHCP
Switch 1 devices received range 168.90.x.x with gateway 168.90.0.1
Switch 2 devices received range 210.3.14.x with gateway 210.3.14.1
